Implementation of MapCar in Java. See http://www.lee-mac.com/mapcarlambda.html for more information on what is a Mapcar
This MapCar is an implementation that takes in a list and a lambda function and returns a list by applying the lambda function to each element of the list

It consists of the following:

1) Abstract lambda function that must be implemented by all classes that extend MapCar.
2) lambda function to be applied to each element of the list

See the sub classes of MapCar (MapCarImpl, MapCarIntegerImpl and MapCarTitleCaseImpl) for three types of implemenation of MapCar.
